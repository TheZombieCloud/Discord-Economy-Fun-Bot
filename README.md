# Econumy - A Fun Discord Economy Bot

Econumy is an ongoing project with the purpose of creating a bot that integrates it own currency (bits and iron). Each user has a base with a wall surrounding their valuables. The wall has a certain amount of health and can be upgradeable. Each user will have a bit and iron generator which allow them to earn bits and iron every minute they talk in Discord (bits and iron are saved globally). Each of these generators are upgradeable. This currency can be used to play fun minigames and purchase certain commands. Each user is also able to purchase offensive and defensive units in order to protect their base, or to infiltrate other bases to steal their loot. 

More info will be given throughout the duration of this project.
